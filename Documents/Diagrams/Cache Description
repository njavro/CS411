Due to the constantly changing nature of stocks it is necessary for the cache 
that holds information about different stocks to be refreshed often. Therefore, 
stored information should include a timestamp of when it was last updated to 
keep track of what information is current and what is not.  It is estimated 
that stock information should be updated if it has not been checked in the last 
15 - 30 minutes.  Company information is not as dynamic, but should be refreshed 
every couple hours.
