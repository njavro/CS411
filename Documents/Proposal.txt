Idea 1: Recommend Groupon deals based off of events in a users calendar. 

The program should take the events on a user's calendar and develop a list
of key words. The key words will then be used to cross check Groupon deals.
Then a finalized list will be developed for the user of relevant Groupon
deals as well as a list of recommended deals that the user may be interested in.

Idea 2: Curated Portfolio Tracker

User inputs the list of stocks of interest and app provides detailed
information and news related to stocks. The APIs will be used to gather
information (financial data and relevant news articles) about said stocks
the user inputs.  The data and articles will then be displayed to the user. 

Possible APIs:
Google News
Yahoo Finance
